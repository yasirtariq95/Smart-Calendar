A standalone application that shows all the upcoming events, geo location (using Google’s API) and
weather (using Weather’s API) within the full monthly view.<br /> It reserves a room for you and save the information in the
database about that particular room, so no one can access it until your meeting ends.<br /> It also saves contact information
about the people you are meeting with.<br /> There is a start and end time of the meeting so the database will make the room
availabe for others once the meeting ends.
